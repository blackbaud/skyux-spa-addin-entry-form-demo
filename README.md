# skyux-spa-addin-entry-form-demo

This SPA demonstrates a SKY Add-in implementation using SKY UX. The example uses the Raiser's Edge NXT Gift Entry form and side loads a vertical add-in tab in the same modal dialog tabset.
This code is running live at https://host.nxt.blackbaud.com/addin-entry-form-demo.
